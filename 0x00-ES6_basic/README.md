ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language specification. It introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript. Here is a brief list of some key features introduced in ES6:

1. **let and const**: Block-scoped variables that offer more predictable and flexible variable declarations.

2. **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for defining functions, providing a more concise and lexical `this` binding.

3. **Classes**: Syntactic sugar for creating objects and implementing object-oriented programming concepts.

4. **Modules**: Built-in support for organizing and sharing code across multiple files, making it easier to create reusable components.

5. **Template Literals**: Enhanced string literals that allow for multiline strings and interpolation of expressions.

6. **Destructuring Assignment**: Convenient syntax for extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables.

7. **Default Parameters**: The ability to set default values for function parameters in a more concise way.

8. **Spread Operator**: A concise syntax for expanding arrays, objects, or iterables into multiple elements.

9. **Rest Parameters**: A way to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

10. **Promises**: A standardized way to handle asynchronous operations, providing better control over callbacks and error handling.

11. **Async/Await**: A modern approach to working with asynchronous code, allowing for more readable and sequential code execution.

12. **Map, Set, and WeakMap**: New data structures that provide efficient ways to store and manipulate collections of data.

These are just a few of the many features introduced in ES6. The update brought significant improvements to JavaScript, making it more expressive, powerful, and easier to work with.
